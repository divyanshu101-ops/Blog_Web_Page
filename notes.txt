/* 
When Express renders home.ejs, it becomes:
header.ejs content
+
home.ejs content
+
footer.ejs content
*/

/* 
If home.ejs looks like:
include header
page content
include footer
*/

/* 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>...</head>
<body>

<nav>...</nav>

<h1>Welcome</h1>

<footer>...</footer>

</body>
</html>

So structurally, it is perfectly valid.
This Pattern is Called:
Layout composition or Template layout pattern
Even production apps use this idea.

/***
Important Rule:::::
This approach is correct only if:
Every page includes header first
Every page includes footer last
If you forget footer include → broken HTML structure.

So be consistent.

/**** For iteration of array we use:

/*** 
What Is req.params?
In Express, params (parameters) are values taken from the URL path.

/posts/5
Here:
/posts → fixed route
5 → dynamic value

When you define route like:
/posts/:id
That :id is called a route parameter.

What Is req.params Exactly?
It is an object.
***/

/***
We use POST routes to delete method because:

ID uniquely identifies post
POST changes server state
req.params reads dynamic URL
.filter() removes item cleanly
Redirect prevents duplicate submission

This is not random.
This is structured backend thinking.

app.use(express.static("public"));

What Static Middleware Does
When you enable static middleware, you are telling Express:
“If a request matches a file inside the public folder, serve it automatically.”
